h tags (h1, h2, etc) don't work for some reason. frustrating
classes don't seem to do shit, use id's for everything i guess. really sucks, don't really know what to do when i have multiple elements needing the same styling (since, you know, you're only supposed to use id's once and that's kinda the WHOLE POINT OF CLASSES)
ugh
has a lot of promise, but i can't use much of my own formatting, especially not variables

ffs, the columns were like, the main thing i was excited about, and i can't even get them to work? fuck me
okay, well got those to work, at least

# -about section formatting
# -contact section
-reformat project items
